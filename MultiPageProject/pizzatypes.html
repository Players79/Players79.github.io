            "Although Neapolitan pizza looks quite a bit like mainstream Italian-American <br> pizza, it has some key distinguishing characteristics. True Neapolitan pizza <br> features special dough made with Neapolitan flour. A Neapolitan pizza has a <br> thick, bready crust and a slightly soft texture in the center. The crust should be <br> slightly burnt on the edges. Traditional toppings include fresh tomato sauce and <br> slices of mozzarella cheese."

            "Deep-dish pizza is much more like a pie than a flatbread. Chefs prepare the <br> dough to have tall crusts on the side and a wide, deep space in the center. The <br> pizza dough is filled with cheese and topped with a layer of sauce. Popular <br> toppings for this famous pizza include sausage, onions and pepperoni."

Margherita pizza honors Italy by incorporating the colors <br> of the Italian flag: red tomatoes, white mozzarella cheese and green basil leaves. <br> Margherita pizza has a spotted pattern with alternating patches of white <br> cheese and red tomatoes, as well as a smattering of green from the basil."
